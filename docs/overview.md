Our language framework helps guide all of our writing for our digital platforms. The language and words we use have a deep impact on the user experience and our business outcomes.

## Our goals for this framework

- **Create consistency** across our platforms to make our experience usable, predictable, and delightful.
- **Empower our team** and make it easy for anyone working on our digital platforms to write clear, effective, and useful content.
- **Create positive change** in the language we use to create compassionate, inclusive, and respective products.

## Fictional product: Foreword

This product language framework is built to support a fictional product: **Foreword**, a platform for people to ask for and share recommendations for books to read, based on shared reading history. All of the examples used in this framework use this fictional product as a basis.

## License and re-use

I created this framework because although there are lots of wonderful examples of content frameworks out there, they’re hard to bring into a product team’s own work. This framework is published with an MIT License. **Please use this framework in part or in whole as the basis for your own team’s product language framework!**

## How to adapt this framework for your product

To make this product language framework best support your own product, go through the examples and update them to reflect real examples from your own product. If you find opportunities to improve your own product’s language while coming up with examples, go for it! It would be easy to use this framework as a starting point for a complete content audit.

Remember, this framework is a starting point. Change it to suit your needs!
